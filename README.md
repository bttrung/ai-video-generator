## This repo will cover user story 1 and 2 in the main project: Robot English Assistant:  https://github.com/bttrung/robot-english-assistant/projects/1


## Purpose: Using deep learning algorithms to generate images related to what we speak (in English, a sentence or a word)

The purpose of this tool is to motivate student to speak English: they can practice English while seeing the images. By this way, it will help the brain learn English faster

---

## Input: speak via mic, in English, 
## Output: generated image(s) related to what speaks

---
This project consists of 3 phases:

### [Done]Phase 1: From speak input file -> generate to text
Techstack: Google Speech Recognition, Deep Learning
Code: https://github.com/bttrung/speak-and-see/blob/master/%5BUS_1%5D_Speech_Recognition_with_google.ipynb

### [In Progress]Phase 2: From text -> generate images

### Phase 3: show images to the webpage
